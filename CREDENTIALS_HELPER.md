# 🤖 Deployment Assistant - Credentials Collection

## What I need from you to deploy:

### 1. GitHub Username
**Question**: What's your GitHub username?
**Why needed**: To set up the repository URL for git push
**Example**: `johnsmith` (from github.com/johnsmith)

### 2. Supabase Project Setup
I'll help you create this, but you need to:
- Go to supabase.com 
- Sign up/login
- Create new project named: `hire-drive-prod`
- Then provide me the credentials

### 3. What happens automatically:
✅ I'll generate the git commands for you
✅ I'll prepare the database schema  
✅ I'll create the environment variables
✅ I'll guide you through Vercel deployment

## Ready to start?

Just tell me your **GitHub username** and I'll begin the automated setup!

**Security Note**: I can't directly access these services, but I can prepare all the commands and configurations for you to copy-paste. This keeps your credentials secure while making deployment super easy! 🔐
